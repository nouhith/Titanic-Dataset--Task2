# Titanic EDA

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook for the Titanic dataset — a well-known dataset used in data science and machine learning projects. The purpose of this notebook is to explore and understand the structure, trends, and patterns within the data to draw initial insights that could inform predictive modeling.

## 📁 File Structure

- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook that includes all the code and analysis related to the Titanic dataset.

## 📊 What’s Inside — EDA Workflow

This notebook walks through a structured EDA process, including:

1. **Generating Summary Statistics**  
   - Mean, median, standard deviation, and other descriptive statistics for key features.

2. **Visualizing Numeric Features**  
   - Histograms and boxplots to understand the distribution and spread of variables like `Age`, `Fare`, etc.

3. **Analyzing Feature Relationships**  
   - Use of pairplots and correlation matrices to study relationships between variables (e.g., how age or fare correlates with survival).

4. **Identifying Patterns and Anomalies**  
   - Highlight trends (e.g., higher survival rate for females or first-class passengers), missing data, and outliers.

5. **Drawing Inferences from Visuals**  
   - Derive feature-level insights from the charts to support future feature engineering or model building.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Make sure the required Python libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells to explore the analysis.

## 🧠 Insights You’ll Discover

- Which groups of passengers had higher survival rates
- The influence of features like `Pclass`, `Sex`, and `Embarked` on survival
- Relationships between continuous variables and survival using plots
- Possible directions for future feature selection and preprocessing

## 📌 Note

This project is focused solely on Exploratory Data Analysis. It does **not** include predictive modeling, though it builds a strong foundation for it.
